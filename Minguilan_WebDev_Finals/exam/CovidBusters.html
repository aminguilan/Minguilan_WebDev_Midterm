  <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
 If you are a close contact of someone with COVID-19 and develop symptoms of COVID-19, call your healthcare provider and tell them about your symptoms and your exposure.
<br>
If you are a resident in a community where person-to-person spread of COVID-19 has been detected and you develop COVID-19 symptoms, call your healthcare provider and tell them about your symptoms.
<br>
If you have been in China or another affected area or have been exposed to someone sick with COVID-19 in the last 14 days, you will face some limitations on your movement and activity  for up to 14 days. Please follow instructions during this time. Your cooperation is integral to the ongoing public health response to try to slow spread of this virus.

    Overview
      </h2>
       <h5> By Mayo Clinic Staff </h5>
    <p>
    Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in China.
<br><br>
The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.
<br><br>
Public health groups, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO, are monitoring the pandemic and posting updates on their websites. These groups have also issued recommendations for preventing and treating the illness.
    </p>
       
     <h2>
     Causes
      </h2>
       <h5> By Mayo Clinic Staff </h5>
    <p>
      
      Infection with the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The virus appears to spread easily among people, and more continues to be discovered over time about how it spreads. Data has shown that it spreads from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth or nose of a person nearby.
<br><br>
It can also spread if a person touches a surface with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes, although this isn't considered to be a main way it spreads.

    Complications
      </h2>
       <h5> By Mayo Clinic Staff </h5>
    <p>
     Although most people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms, the disease can cause severe medical complications and lead to death in some people. Older adults or people with existing chronic medical conditions are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.

      What is the difference between Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19?
      </h2>
       <h5> Last Updated May 13, 2020 | Content source: National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Division of Viral Diseases</h5>
    <p>
      
      Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, 
      but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by 
       infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is 
       caused by infection with influenza viruses. Because some of the 
       symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell
       the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing 
       may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 
       share many characteristics, but there are some key differences 
       between the two. While more is learned every day, there is still 
       a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and the virus that causes 
       it. This page compares COVID-19 and flu, given the best available 
       information to date.
