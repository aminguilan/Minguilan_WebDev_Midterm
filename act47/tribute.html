        They are composed of 13 members. They are self-producing idols. They have 3 units, the performance team, the <br>vocal team and the hiphop team. They are also known as the king of synchronization, because they really are. <br>They called their fans as “CARAT” because the leader said that “You guys made us shine so bright. <br>So you guys are now going to be our CARAT.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It started this year when I asked my friend about them. My friend told me that I  should watch their shows because<br>  it is so funny and they are so beautiful. 
          One day I started to watch their variety shows like Going Seventeen, Hit the <br> Road, One fine day, the Inside Seventeen and a lot more of their contents. So, I started to stan them.  Each of them <br>  have a different type of character but  when they are all in the same place they just clicked! You will be also  amazed <br>  at their friendship. They are together for years and they are living in the same roof so basically they are just family.  <br>  I just love it how they adore their fans so much and put their fans first before them.

          They have this song titled “Thanks”. It is for their fans because they are so grateful for them. They have this pinky  <br>  promise finger move and it shows that they promised to do their best and be forever with CARATS. They also have  <br> the song titled “Hug” and it really gives me comfort. First day of my summer class I breakdown because it seems  <br>  like I can’t handle this type of new learning technique. And I played that song and the lyrics is just so beautiful. It gives  <br>  you comfort. Starting that day if I feel like crying, I will just listen to that song because it feels like someone is always   <br>  there for me to help me make at ease.
